# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Job Bar (belowEditor)**: Active carrier jobs (sortie, squadron, taskforce) now render as horizontal tiles below the editor input. Empty editor + active jobs + ↓ enters virtual focus mode; ←→ navigates between tiles; Enter expands a job to show streaming content at its position; Esc/↑ returns to editor.
- **Job Bar Track Tree**: All job kinds (sortie, squadron, taskforce) render tracks in a unified `├─`/`└─` tree with per-track signature colors and status icons. The latest active streaming block is merged inline on the track line via a `·` separator.
- **Job Bar Visual Polish**: Focused tiles are wrapped in `[...]` brackets with carrier-colored wave animation. Spinner and completion icons (`⏺`) use carrier signature colors throughout tiles and track trees.

### Changed
- **Job Bar Inline Streaming**: Expanded tracks render the latest active streaming block inline on the same line as the track header (`· <text>`), replacing the previous multi-line child block rendering below each track. `MAX_EXPANDED_STREAM_LINES` reduced from 5 to 1.
- **Unified Streaming Color**: All inline streaming text uses a single `STREAM_INLINE_COLOR` (rgb(100,210,245)) regardless of block type (ToolCall, Text, Thought).
- **Sortie Tree Depth Unification**: Sortie jobs now always render with tree depth (`├─`/`└─`) identical to Squadron and Taskforce, even for single-carrier sorties. Direct inline streaming on the sortie tile line is removed.

### Removed
- **`[N tools]` Track Stats**: Removed the `[N tools]` tool-call statistic from track lines.
- **`appendSingleTrackStream()`**: Replaced by the inline streaming approach.
- **`latestInlineBlock()`**: Unused after Sortie tree rendering unification.
- **`trackStatsText()`**: Removed along with `[N tools]` display.
- **`blockLineToAnsi` import in `job-bar-renderer.ts`**: No longer consumed by the Job Bar renderer; the export in `block-renderer.ts` is retained for `panel-renderer.ts` and `message-renderers.ts` consumers.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-05-01

### Changed
- **HUD Status Bar → Editor Bottom Border**: Relocated the HUD status bar from a standalone `belowEditor` widget into the editor's bottom border line, producing a more compact single-line layout.
- **Operation Name → Editor Top Border (Right)**: Moved the operation name display from the status bar segment to the editor's top-right border label alongside the protocol label.
- **HUD State Shared Singleton**: Replaced per-module `HudEditorState` creation in `hud-lifecycle` and `hud-command` with a single shared state factory (`hud/state.ts`), eliminating dual-state divergence.
- **Model Change Reactivity**: Added `model_select` event handler with `selectedModel` stored directly from `event.model`, bypassing stale `ctx.model` getter issues on session boundaries.
- **`buildSegmentContext` Resilience**: Wrapped ctx-dependent accessors (`sessionManager`, `modelRegistry`) in an internal try/catch so that stale-ctx throws no longer propagate; `selectedModel` and other ctx-independent data are always returned.

### Removed
- **`globalThis` HUD Render Bridge**: Removed `__pi_hud_render_request__` globalThis bridge; `fleet.ts` now imports `requestHudRender()` directly from `editor.ts`.
- **`globalThis` Border Bridge**: Replaced globalThis-based editor border/label storage in `border-bridge.ts` with module-level variables.
- **`operationSegment` Dead Code**: Removed the unused `operationSegment` definition, `SegmentContext.operationName` field, and `getOperationNameForSession()` helper from `hud-context.ts` (operation name now flows through `border-bridge` only).
- **`editorTheme` Confusion**: Eliminated the `editorTheme` (editor factory visual config) being passed where a full PI `Theme` was expected; `state.themeRef` (captured from the footer callback) is now the sole theme source for segment rendering.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-05-01

### Added
- **`opencode-go` CLI Provider**: Added the OpenCode Go CLI as a first-class provider in `packages/unified-agent`, including `UnifiedOpenCodeAgentClient`, `CLI_BACKENDS` entry, models entry, and dedicated E2E coverage. The Fleet ACP provider, ModelRegistry, and CLI registry are centralized accordingly.
- **`claude-zai` / `claude-kimi` CLI Providers**: Added Z.AI GLM and Moonshot Kimi backends as Claude-family aliases of `UnifiedClaudeAgentClient` (separate `defaultEnv.ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, separate `models.json` entries, npx bridge with `--cli`).
- **`fleet-core` Auth Service**: New `services/auth/` module exposing `AuthService` (`getApiKey`/`setApiKey`/`setAuthPath`) on `FleetServices.auth`. Reads and writes `~/.pi/agent/auth.json` via Node `fs`; the default path is overridable via `setAuthPath()`.
- **`resolveAuthEnv(cli)` Helper**: New shared helper exported from `@sbluemin/fleet-core` that maps `claude-zai` / `claude-kimi` to their `auth.json` provider IDs and returns `{ ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN }`. Throws when a mapped cli has no token registered. Both `agent-runtime.buildConnectOptions` (detached sortie/squadron/taskforce) and `provider-stream.buildProviderConnectOptions` (host PI agent) consume it as the single source of truth.
- **`CLI_TO_AUTH_PROVIDER_ID` Mapping**: Constant exported from `@sbluemin/fleet-core` that maps `claude-zai` → `Claude Code with Z.AI GLM` and `claude-kimi` → `Claude Code with Moonshot Kimi`.

### Changed
- **CLI Display Name SSoT — `models.json`**: `packages/unified-agent/models.json` (`providers.<cli>.name`) is now the sole source of truth for CLI provider display names. `fleet-core` `CLI_PROVIDER_DISPLAY_NAMES` derives directly from `getProviderModels(cli).name` with no vendor/`CLI` suffix stripping. All downstream consumers (status store, taskforce overlay, model UI, etc.) now go through this surface.
- **`buildConnectOptions` is now async**: `agent-runtime.buildConnectOptions` returns `Promise<UnifiedClientOptions>` and uses `resolveAuthEnv(cli)`, so detached carrier paths (`carriers_sortie`, `carrier_squadron`, `carrier_taskforce`) automatically receive the per-cli auth env.
- **`buildProviderConnectOptions` Consolidation**: `provider-stream.buildProviderConnectOptions` is async and shares the `resolveAuthEnv` helper; the inline `CLI_TO_AUTH_PROVIDER_ID` and `fleet.auth.getApiKey` calls are removed.
- **Fleet ACP Provider Split**: The Fleet ACP provider implementation is split per CLI and now sources provider names from `models.json`. Unified provider labels are aligned across the runtime.
- **Carrier Job Launch Notice**: Clarified the language of the carrier job launch notice for less ambiguity.

### Removed
- **`CLI_BACKENDS.name` Field**: The `name` property on every `CLI_BACKENDS` entry and on the `CliBackendConfig` type is removed; consumers must use `getProviderModels(cli).name` (= `models.json`).
- **Local `CLI_DISPLAY_NAMES` Hardcode**: Removed the local `CLI_DISPLAY_NAMES` constant from `packages/pi-fleet-extension/src/agent/ui/carrier-ui/taskforce-config-overlay.ts`; the overlay now imports `CLI_DISPLAY_NAMES` from `@sbluemin/fleet-core/constants`.
- **Vendor / `CLI` Suffix Stripping**: Dropped the historic `.replace(/ CLI$/, "").replace("Anthropic ", "")...` strip pipeline for display names.
- **`provider-catalog` Thin Wrapper**: Removed `packages/fleet-core/src/admiral/store/provider-catalog.ts` and its re-export. All consumers now use `@sbluemin/unified-agent`'s `getProviderModels` and `getReasoningEffortLevels` directly as the single source of truth.
- **`CLAUDE_THINKING_BUDGETS` Default Auto-Fill**: Removed automatic Claude budget token filling from `fleet-store`, `model-ui`, `alt-o-status-overlay`, `taskforce-config-overlay`, and `status-overlay`. Budget tokens now flow only when explicitly user-set; otherwise the value falls back to unified-agent defaults.
- **`MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT` Env Injection**: Dropped the historic `MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT: "1800000"` env injection from all carrier connect paths (host and detached); no longer needed.
- **`opencode-zai` / `opencode-kimi` Providers**: Pruned the OpenCode Z.AI / Moonshot variants; only `opencode-go` remains under the OpenCode surface.
- **HUD Context Window & Cache Usage**: Removed the context window rendering and cache usage tracking from the HUD layout.

## [0.6.6] - 2026-04-30

Release v0.6.6

## [0.6.5] - 2026-04-30

### Removed
- **Agent Service Cleanup**: Entire `packages/fleet-core/src/services/agent/` directory (23 files) removed as part of the destructive cleansing.
- **Legacy Agent Services**: Removed `packages/fleet-core/src/public/agent-services.ts` and its exports (`FleetAgentServices`, `FleetAgentRuntimeHost`, `BackendAdapter`, `BackendConnectOptions`, `BackendSession`, `AgentStreamingSink`, `FleetHostPorts`, `UnifiedAgentRequestOptions`, `UnifiedAgentBackgroundRequestOptions`, `UnifiedAgentRequestStatus`, `UnifiedAgentResult`, `executeAgentCore`, `createAgentServices`).
- **Legacy Tool Registry Services**: Removed `packages/fleet-core/src/public/tool-registry-services.ts` and its exports (`FleetToolRegistryServices`, `FleetToolRegistryPorts`, `FleetToolRegistryHostPorts`, `AgentToolRegistry`, `McpRegistryAPI`, `McpServerHandle`, `McpServerOptions`, `PendingToolCall`, `PendingToolResult`, `createAgentToolRegistry`, `createFleetToolRegistry`, `createMcpServerForRegistry`, `createToolRegistryServices`).
- **Deprecated Subpaths (Breaking)**: Removed 16 deprecated public subpaths under `@sbluemin/fleet-core/agent/*` (shared/types, shared/client, shared/service-status, provider/types, provider/provider-types, provider/client, provider/provider-client, provider/mcp, provider/provider-mcp, provider/thinking-level-patch, provider/tool-snapshot, dispatcher/runtime, dispatcher/session-store, dispatcher/session-resume-utils, dispatcher/pool, dispatcher/executor).
- **Double Definition Resolution**: Removed duplicate definitions in `packages/pi-fleet-extension/src/agent/provider-internal/{mcp.ts, tool-snapshot.ts}`.
- **Runtime Field Reductions**: Removed `agent`, `toolRegistry`, and `mcp` fields from `FleetCoreRuntimeContext`.
- **Wrapper Type Purge**: Removed all `Fleet*` prefix wrapper types (`FleetAgentClient`, `FleetAcpToolCall`, `FleetAcpToolCallUpdate`, `FleetAcpContentBlock`, `FleetMcpConfig`, `FleetProviderConnect*`, `FleetAgentClientEvents`, `FleetProviderLogEntry`, `FleetAcpSessionInfo`, `FleetConnectionState`) in favor of direct unified-agent types.
- **Adapter Removal**: Removed `UnifiedFleetAgentClientAdapter` class and `createAgentRequestService` media layer.

### Added
- **New Agent Runtime Subpath**: Introduced `@sbluemin/fleet-core/admiral/agent-runtime` subpath for core execution logic (`executeOneShot`, `executeWithPool`, `applyPostConnectConfig`, `getClientPool`, `isClientAlive`, `disconnectClient`, `disconnectAll`, `cleanIdleClients`, `initRuntime`, `onHostSessionChange`, `getSessionStore`, `getSessionId`, `getDataDir`, `classifyResumeFailure`, `isDeadSessionError`, `createSessionMapStore`).
- **Lazy Tool Registration**: Added `FleetServices.tools` lazy getter for automatic registration of `sortie`, `squadron`, `taskforce`, and `carrier_jobs` tools.
- **Unified MCP API**: Added `FleetServices.mcp` with automatic lifecycle management, tool registration, resolution of next tool calls, and pending call management.
- **Service Status Module**: Added `packages/unified-agent/src/service-status/` for provider health tracking (`ServiceSnapshot`, `HealthStatus`, `ProviderKey`, `ServiceStatusCallbacks`, `ServiceStatusContextPort`).
- **Shared Admiral Components**: Added `packages/fleet-core/src/admiral/_shared/{mcp.ts, agent-runtime.ts}`.
- **Tool Snapshot & Specs**: Added `packages/fleet-core/src/services/tool-registry/tool-snapshot.ts` and `packages/fleet-core/src/admiral/carrier-jobs/tool-spec.ts`.
- **Extension Internals**: Added state and session runtime management in `packages/pi-fleet-extension/src/agent/provider-internal/` (`state.ts`, `session-runtime.ts`, `service-status-store.ts`).
- **Port Types**: Added `FleetServicesPorts` type for host-provided capabilities (`logDebug`, `runAgentRequestBackground`, `enqueueCarrierCompletionPush`).

### Changed
- **Runtime Initialization**: `createFleetCoreRuntime` signature changed to `{ dataDir: string; ports: FleetServicesPorts }`.
- **Runtime Context Refactor**: `FleetCoreRuntimeContext` now strictly contains `fleet`, `grandFleet`, `metaphor`, `jobs`, `log`, `settings`, and `shutdown`.
- **MCP Server Lifecycle**: McpServer lifecycle management internalised; it now auto-starts on the first `fleet.mcp.url()` call and auto-terminates via `FleetCoreRuntimeContext.shutdown()`.
- **Tool Source Unification**: Single source of truth for tools established in `pi-fleet-extension` by injecting fleet tools into the MCP registry via `fleet.mcp.registerTools`.
- **Import Migration**: All internal and extension imports previously using `@sbluemin/fleet-core/agent/*` subpaths have been migrated to `@sbluemin/unified-agent`, `@sbluemin/fleet-core/admiral/agent-runtime`, or direct runtime service access.
- **Thinking Level Patch**: Rewritten `packages/pi-fleet-extension/src/agent/provider-internal/thinking-level-patch.ts` for the new internal structure.

### Breaking Changes
- **Public API Reduction**: Massive reduction of the public API surface; all downstream consumers must be updated to use the new simplified service patterns.
- **Subpath Removal**: All 16 `@sbluemin/fleet-core/agent/*` subpaths are completely removed and no longer export symbols.
- **Service & Wrapper Removal**: `FleetAgentServices`, `FleetHostPorts`, `FleetToolRegistryServices`, and all `Fleet*` prefix wrapper classes are removed.
- **Runtime Signature Change**: `createFleetCoreRuntime` now strictly requires the new `ports: FleetServicesPorts` argument, making the host-extension contract more explicit.
- **Context Field Removal**: `FleetCoreRuntimeContext.agent`, `.toolRegistry`, and `.mcp` fields are removed; access these capabilities via the unified `fleet` service.

## [0.6.4] - 2026-04-30

Release v0.6.4

## [0.6.3] - 2026-04-30

### Added
- **Detached Fanout Helper**: Extracted `packages/fleet-core/src/admiral/_shared/detached-fanout.ts` to unify detached parallel-job runner logic for Squadron and TaskForce domains, reducing code duplication.
- **Provider Catalog Extraction**: Split `packages/fleet-core/src/admiral/store/provider-catalog.ts` from `fleet-store.ts` to isolate model and budget definitions.

### Changed
- **pi-fleet-extension Restructure**: Restructured `pi-fleet-extension` to Flat Domain Architecture mirroring `fleet-core` public services. Each `fleet-core` service maps 1:1 to a `pi-fleet-extension` domain (`agent/`, `fleet.ts`, `grand-fleet/`, `metaphor.ts`, `job.ts`, `settings.ts`, `log.ts`, `tool-registry.ts`, `fleet-wiki/`).
- **Doctrine Update**: Doctrine "capability bucket organization" replaced with "service-mirror domain organization". Each domain now owns its commands, keybinds, tools, and TUI internally as files within the domain folder.
- **Entry Point Refactor**: Host entry split into `boot.ts` (runtime composition) and `ports.ts` (`FleetHostPorts` implementation). Host shell consolidated into its own `shell/` domain.
- **Gateway Location**: `@mariozechner/pi-ai` gateway moved from `src/provider/pi-ai-bridge.ts` to within `src/agent/` domain (single domain-internal gateway).
- AGENTS doctrine "compat isolation pattern" replaced with "provider gateway pattern" — only `packages/pi-fleet-extension/src/agent/` domain internal gateway is allowed to import `@mariozechner/pi-ai`.
- **Internal Agent Logging**: The agent domain now directly consumes `services/log` for logging instead of using a dedicated log-port bridge.
- **TaskForce State Pattern**: Updated TaskForce state to use a `Map<requestKey, TaskForceState>` instead of a single global slot, preventing state collisions during concurrent executions on the same carrier.
- **Service Unification**: Consolidated `services/log` and `services/settings` implementations. `log/store.ts` now absorbs API initialization, and `settings/service.ts` inlines Map wrapper logic.
- **Bridge Barrel Contraction**: Converted `admiral/bridge/` barrels (`run-stream`, `carrier-panel`, `carrier-control`) to allowlist-only named exports, hiding internal state and types from public surface.
- **Carrier Prompt Refactor**: Replaced certain dynamic `derive` helper calls in `admiral/carrier/prompts.ts` with direct manifest field references for performance.
- **Agent Runtime Assembly**: Inlined agent runtime assembly helpers into `public/runtime.ts`.

### Removed
- **Legacy Capability Buckets**: Removed `pi-fleet-extension` legacy capability buckets `src/commands/`, `src/keybinds/`, `src/session/`, `src/tools/`, `src/tui/`, and `src/provider/`. All content has been absorbed into their respective domain homes.
- Removed `pi-fleet-extension/src/bindings/` capability bucket (admiral, carrier, compat, config, grand-fleet, hud, jobs, metaphor, runtime). Service consumption now uses `fleet-core` public surface directly; `@mariozechner/pi-ai` gateway moved to `src/agent/` domain; runtime glue moved to `src/boot.ts` and `src/ports.ts`; grand-fleet glue moved to `src/grand-fleet/`; HUD lifecycle moved to `src/fleet.ts`; carrier panel sink moved to `src/fleet.ts`; carrier completion glue moved to `src/job.ts`.
- Removed `fleet-core` public types `LlmClient`, `LlmCompleteMessage`, `LlmCompleteRequest`, `LlmCompleteResult` (dead code; `FleetAgentClient` is the active replacement).
- Removed `@sbluemin/fleet-core/agent/shared/log-port` subpath and `FleetLogPort` interface.
- Demoted `BackendAdapter`, `BackendConnectOptions`, `BackendRequest`, `BackendResponse`, and `BackendSession` from `fleet-core` public exports.
- **Public Subpaths (Breaking)**: Removed 8 public subpaths from `fleet-core` that had zero external consumers:
  - `./runtime`
  - `./agent`
  - `./agent/shared`
  - `./agent/provider`
  - `./agent/dispatcher`
  - `./admiral/protocols`
  - `./services`
  - `./admiralty/ipc`
- **Dead Files**:
  - `packages/fleet-core/src/admiral/carrier/register.ts` (overridden by Pi tool-registry).
  - `packages/fleet-core/src/services/log/runtime.ts` (absorbed into `store.ts`).
  - `packages/fleet-core/src/services/settings/registry.ts` (inlined).
  - `packages/fleet-core/src/services/agent/fleet-agent-runtime.ts` (absorbed into `public/runtime.ts`).
  - `packages/pi-fleet-extension/src/agent/carrier/register.ts` (legacy shim).
- **Removed Exports/Symbols**:
  - `registerSingleCarrier`, `ensureShipyardLogCategories`, `SingleCarrierOptions`.
  - `getSquadronState`, `sanitizeTitle` (private/dead).
  - `isTaskForceFormable` (unused public).
  - `getProtocolById` (changed to private internal).
  - `TASKFORCE_STATE_KEY`, `CORE_SETTINGS_KEY` (dead).
  - `createActiveRecordFromSummary`, `renderToolPromptManifestMarkdown` (dead).

### Breaking Changes
- **Agent Service Reorganization**: Refactored `packages/fleet-core/src/services/agent/` into a 3-bucket structure (`shared/`, `provider/`, `dispatcher/`) for better isolation between internal runtime and provider contracts.
  - Consumers of internal agent subpaths must migrate to the new structure:
    - `@sbluemin/fleet-core/agent` (legacy barrel) -> `@sbluemin/fleet-core/agent/dispatcher/runtime` or root exports.
    - `@sbluemin/fleet-core/agent/types` -> `@sbluemin/fleet-core/agent/shared/types`.
    - `@sbluemin/fleet-core/agent/provider-mcp` -> `@sbluemin/fleet-core/agent/provider/provider-mcp`.
    - `@sbluemin/fleet-core/agent/executor` -> `@sbluemin/fleet-core/agent/dispatcher/executor`.
  - Representative consumer `pi-fleet-extension` has been updated in the same release; external consumers must update their import paths accordingly.
- **Log Port Removal**: Removed the `FleetLogPort` interface and the `@sbluemin/fleet-core/agent/shared/log-port` subpath.
  - `FleetHostPorts.log` field has been removed.
  - `AgentToolCtx.log` field has been removed.
  - Consumers must migrate to `services/log` directly (via `initLogAPI`/`getLogAPI`) for log interactions.
- **Bridge Export Policy**: Accessing internal bridge state or raw track/job types via `admiral/bridge/*` is no longer supported. Consumers must use the provided allowlist exports.
- **Subpath Removal**: Direct imports from the 8 removed subpaths will fail. Consumers should use the root barrel or the remaining compatibility subpaths documented in `PUBLIC_API.md`.
- **TaskForce State**: `TASKFORCE_STATE_KEY` is removed; taskforce state is now managed internally via request keys.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-04-30

### Removed
- Removed Fleet Wiki AAR support, including the `wiki_aar_propose` MCP tool, the `aar_only` capture mode, and all AAR-specific prompt/schema surfaces.
- Removed the Fleet Wiki `append_log` patch operation, the `.fleet/knowledge/log/` store directory, and the AAR-only types and validation paths tied to log entries.
- Removed AAR references from Fleet Wiki capture wiring and aligned AGENTS/README doctrine with the remaining `wiki_ingest`, `wiki_briefing`, `wiki_drydock`, and `wiki_patch_queue` surfaces.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-04-30

### Changed
- Renamed all `experimental-wiki` directories, import paths, and symbol names to `fleet-wiki` across `packages/pi-fleet-extension`; `bootExperimentalWiki` → `bootFleetWiki`, `registerExperimentalWiki` → `registerFleetWiki`.
- Updated related documentation (`AGENTS.md` files, `docs/`) to reflect the `fleet-wiki` naming and remove legacy `experimental-wiki` references.
- Fleet Bridge Agent Panel now auto-collapses completed track streaming details into a single inline `✓ Done` suffix on the track header, replacing the previous multi-line tool call list + separate `✓ Completed` line.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-30

### Added
- Extracted the experimental wiki domain into the new `@sbluemin/fleet-wiki` workspace package and moved its source and tests out of `fleet-core`.

### Changed
- Move `request_directive` schema and validators, carrier framework mutators, and grand-fleet tool spec definitions into `@sbluemin/fleet-core`; `pi-fleet-extension/src/tools` retains its current structure and consumes host-agnostic specs from fleet-core.
- Updated `pi-fleet-extension` experimental wiki adapters to consume `@sbluemin/fleet-wiki`, while `FleetCoreRuntime.experimentalWiki` remains as a compatibility key typed as `unknown`.
- Re-embedded the gfleet domain under `packages/fleet-core/src/gfleet/`, exposed again through `@sbluemin/fleet-core/gfleet`, `@sbluemin/fleet-core/gfleet/ipc`, and `@sbluemin/fleet-core/gfleet/formation`.

### Removed

### Breaking Changes
- External consumers of the former Fleet Core Grand Fleet entrypoints must migrate to `@sbluemin/fleet-core/gfleet*`; symbol names are unchanged.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-28

Release v0.5.0

## [0.4.1] - 2026-04-28

### Removed
- **Codex `service_tier` config support**: Removed `service_tier` from `CODEX_TURN_LEVEL_CONFIG_KEYS` and its pending-override cleanup logic in `UnifiedCodexAgentClient`.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-28

Release v0.4.0

## [0.3.3] - 2026-04-27

### Added
- **Fleet Bridge PanelJob Streaming Model**: Added a job-scoped `PanelJob` + `ColumnTrack` model so `carriers_sortie`, `carrier_squadron`, and `carrier_taskforce` all stream through the Fleet Bridge panel instead of Messages renderers.
- **Bridge Doctrine File**: Added `extensions/fleet/bridge/AGENTS.md` to document the Fleet Bridge UI/runtime boundary, PanelJob invariants, and the rule that shipyard tools keep Messages `renderCall` output to a fixed one-line summary.

### Changed
- **Phase 1 Restructure — Scope Triage + Mandatory Reconnaissance**: Split Fleet Action Protocol Phase 1 into two sub-phases: Phase 1a (Scope Triage) limits Admiral-direct file reads to ~2 files for scope classification only; Phase 1b (Vanguard Mandatory) requires Vanguard reconnaissance via `carrier_squadron` when 3+ files or modules are involved or scope is unclear.
- **Delegation Policy — Tighter Direct Handling Threshold**: Reduced "Handle directly" file lookup limit from ~5 to ~2 files (scope triage only). Lowered investigation delegation threshold from 6+ to 3+ files. Vanguard reconnaissance is now mandatory when scope remains unclear after triage.
- **Anti-pattern Addition**: Added "Reading 3+ files directly to gather context instead of sortieing Vanguard/Tempest" to the Delegation Policy anti-patterns list.
- **JobStreamArchive Read-Many Policy**: Full archived results via `carrier_jobs` are no longer invalidated after the first read. Both summary cache and full archive now share the same read-many semantics with a 3-hour TTL. `getAndInvalidate()` renamed to `getFinalized()`.
- **Fleet Bridge Rendering**: Reworked the expanded Fleet Bridge panel into job-scoped columns, where each active sortie, squadron, or taskforce appears as its own column with a tree of tracks and the latest five streaming lines.
- **Shipyard Tool Rendering**: Replaced dynamic streaming `renderCall` components for sortie, squadron, and taskforce tools with fixed-height one-line summaries to avoid PI TUI scroll jumps while preserving live output in Fleet Bridge.
- **Shipyard Tool Summary Colors**: Applied tool-kind colors to Sortie, Taskforce, and Squadron `renderCall` labels and payload text, reusing the Status Bar TF/SQ badge colors for taskforce and squadron summaries.
- **Carrier Status Animation**: Limited the carrier status spinner animation to sortie-style carrier streaming; squadron and taskforce jobs now keep the status bar stable while their detailed progress streams in Fleet Bridge.

### Fixed
- **Thought Block Test Alignment**: Two `carrier-job-shared` tests that expected thought blocks in the archive now correctly reflect the thought-exclusion policy introduced in v0.3.2.
- **Sortie Panel Streaming**: Fixed sortie tracks staying idle in Fleet Bridge by binding PanelJob tracks to the actual stream-store run after the background run is created, instead of prebinding stale visible run IDs.
- **Panel Runtime Stability**: Removed a panel state/jobs circular import and foreground active-job side effects that could break Fleet Bridge rendering or leave PI unable to send follow-up chat messages after a reload.
- **Carrier Jobs Verbose Rendering**: Wrapped verbose `carrier_jobs` JSON output by terminal width so large `full_result` payloads cannot produce extremely long TUI lines.

### Removed
- **Legacy Fleet Bridge Switching UI**: Removed job-bar switching state and obsolete job navigation shortcuts now that all active jobs render simultaneously as panel columns.
- **Shipyard Streaming Components**: Removed the old dynamic Messages streaming components and related dead code from sortie, squadron, and taskforce tool renderers.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-04-27

Release v0.3.2

## [0.3.1] - 2026-04-26

### Changed
- **Dev Mode RISEN Prompt**: Boot extension now injects a RISEN (Role-Instructions-Steps-EndGoal-Narrowing) prompt for pi-fleet development via `before_agent_start` when running `fleet-dev`. Fleet persona/role/tone sections are skipped in dev mode.
- **System Prompt Registration via `before_agent_start`**: Removed `setCliSystemPrompt`/`getCliSystemPrompt` globalThis bridge entirely. All system prompt registration now uses pi's `before_agent_start` Append pattern (boot → fleet → grand-fleet order).
- **Function Renames**: `buildAcpSystemPrompt` → `buildSystemPrompt`, `buildAcpRuntimeContext` → `buildRuntimeContextPrompt`.
- **Prompt Section Tags**: Unified individual XML tags (`<fleet_role>`, `<fleet_persona>`, etc.) into `<fleet-system section="...">` tag format.

### Added
- **Log Category Registry**: Introduced pre-registration system for log categories. Unregistered category logs are silently ignored. Categories can be toggled on/off via `fleet:log:settings` and `fleet:log:category` slash commands.
- **System Prompt Logging**: Full system prompt is now logged under the `acp-system-prompt` category on each ACP request (`hideFromFooter` applied).
- **Documentation Links**: Added `docs/` directory links to README.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-26

### Changed
- **`<system-reminder>` Doctrine Realignment**: Restricted `<system-reminder>` wrapping to `pi.sendMessage`-delivered carrier completion pushes only.
    - Synchronous tool responses — launch acceptance text and `carrier_jobs` `notice` field — are now returned as plain text without any XML wrapping.
    - Completion pushes now carry a `source="carrier-completion"` attribute on `<system-reminder>` so the Admiral can identify framework-delivered carrier completion events.
    - `LAUNCH_REMINDER_TEXT` renamed to `JOB_LAUNCH_NOTICE` and compressed to a 2-sentence plain-text guidance referencing the new push attribute.
    - `wrapSystemReminder(text, attrs?)` signature extended to accept optional XML attributes; sole production caller is now `_shared/push.ts`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-26

### Added
- **Carrier Jobs In-band Guidance**: Added a `notice` field to `carrier_jobs` responses for active jobs to deter LLMs from unnecessary polling.
    - Notices are now written in imperative form (e.g., "Stop calling tools now") and wrapped with `wrapSystemReminder` (`<system-reminder>` tag) to ensure LLM compliance.
    - `ACTIVE_STATUS_NOTICE`: Mode-agnostic guidance to wait for the `[carrier:result]` push; reinforces that the push wakes the agent even after the current response ends.
    - `ACTIVE_CANCEL_NOTICE`: Guidance when cancellation fails, clarifying that long-running jobs are expected and the job is not hung.
- **Push Delivery Mode Configuration**:
    - New slash command `/fleet:jobs:mode` to switch between `followUp` (default) and `steer` (advanced) push delivery modes.
    - SettingsOverlay (Alt+/) integration for "Push Mode" selection.
    - Persistent configuration in `~/.pi/fleet/settings.json` under the `fleet-push-mode` section.

### Changed
- **Improved Retry Guidance**: Updated the `retry_after` message for active job results to explicitly instruct against manual retries, reinforcing reliance on the automatic push mechanism.
- **Dynamic Push Delivery**: The `carrier-result` push delivery mode is now dynamic and respects the user-configured setting (defaulting to `followUp`).

## [0.1.3] - 2026-04-26

Tactical Steel rebranding + Ohio commission.

### Added
- **Asynchronous Carrier Operations**: `carriers_sortie`, `carrier_taskforce`, and `carrier_squadron` now operate in fire-and-forget mode.
- **New `carrier_jobs` Meta Tool**: Introduced for managing detached carrier jobs with actions: `status`, `result`, `cancel`, and `list`.
- **Job Stream Archive**: Centralized storage for detached job outputs with 3-hour TTL and 8MB/2000-block capacity limits.
- **Result Push Mechanism**: Framework now pushes `[carrier:result]` signals to notify the Admiral of job completion.
- New `Ohio` carrier (CVN-10, Codex CLI) — sole receiver of `plan_file` (under `.fleet/plans/*.md`), executes WBS waves end-to-end.
- Global executable commands (`fleet`, `gfleet`, `fleet-dev`, `gfleet-dev`).
- CI workflow to auto-tag main pushes with CHANGELOG section as annotated message.
- Pull request template (`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`).
- Admiral workflow reference documentation (`docs/admiral-workflow-reference.md`).

### Changed
- **Worldview-aware `<fleet_role>`**: When the `metaphor.worldview` toggle is OFF, `buildAcpSystemPrompt()` now injects a neutral role prompt (`FLEET_ROLE_PROMPT_NEUTRAL`) that drops naval honorifics, report-form enforcement, and Bridge/Helm metaphors while preserving functional contracts (carrier delegation, pi-tools lazy-loading awareness, Korean-only responses). Persona/tone overlays remain gated by the same toggle.
- **Worldview-aware Grand Fleet role prompts**: When the `metaphor.worldview` toggle is OFF, `extensions/grand-fleet/prompts.ts` now switches Admiralty/Fleet/Fleet ACP role variants to neutral prompts, neutralizes Admiralty designation guidance, and only injects Fleet persona/tone into ACP base prompts when Grand Fleet context is omitted so metaphor tone no longer leaks through worldview-disabled paths.
- **Metaphor Domain Integration**: Unified `improve-prompt` into `directive-refinement` and migrated it to the `metaphor` extension domain.
    - New Settings Path: `metaphor.directiveRefinement` (replaces legacy `core-improve-prompt`).
    - New Slash Command: `fleet:metaphor:directive`.
    - Integrated **3-section (3섹션)** Output Format: Refined directives now follow a structured "Directive / Rationale / Residual Risks" markdown schema.
    - Updated documentation (`AGENTS.md`, `SETUP.md`) to reflect the new naval hierarchy domain boundaries.
- **Tool Contract Refactoring**: Carrier tools now return a `job_id` immediately instead of waiting for full execution.
- **Read-Once Result Policy**: Full archived results via `carrier_jobs` are now invalidated after the first successful retrieval to manage memory footprint.
- Renamed `Oracle` → `Nimitz` (CVN-09, Strategic Command & Judgment, read-only).
- Renamed `Athena` → `Kirov` (CVN-02, Operational Planning Bridge, plan_file author).
- Renamed `Echelon` → `Tempest` (CVN-07, Forward External Intelligence Strike).
- Genesis reverted to single-shot implementation; `plan_file` request block and related principles removed.
- Admiral delegation doctrine replaced "Oracle vs Athena Decision Flow" with "Nimitz → Kirov → Ohio 3-Step Strike Pipeline".
- Reorganized keybind overlay categories for better clarity:
    - `Alt+M` (metaphor-directive-refinement `refine-directive`): `Meta Prompt` → `Metaphor`.
    - `Alt+T` (bridge `launch`): `Bridge` → `Fleet Bridge`.
    - `Alt+O` (fleet `carrier-status`): `Fleet` → `Fleet Bridge`.
- Updated Fleet Bridge status bar hints (`PANEL_MULTI_COL_HINT` and `PANEL_DETAIL_HINT`) by removing retired `alt+x cancel` and `alt+shift+m model` references.
- Refreshed README structure and renamed Agent Panel to Fleet Bridge.
- Split grand fleet role pipelines and fleet wiring, and tightened Kirov planning contract.

### Fixed
- Restored ACP session resume.
- Serialized fleet state writes to prevent race conditions.

### Removed
- `Alt+S` (core-hud `stash`): Removed editor text stashing/restoration and associated session/agent lifecycle management.
- `Alt+Shift+M` (fleet `model-change`): Removed shortcut for changing carrier models. Operators should use the `fleet:agent:models` slash command or the `Alt+O` settings overlay instead.
- `Alt+R` (core-improve-prompt `reasoning-cycle`): Removed meta-prompt reasoning level cycle shortcut. Reasoning levels can still be adjusted via `fleet:prompt:settings`.
- `Alt+X` (fleet `carrier-cancel`): Removed operation cancellation shortcut and retired the underlying abort controller infrastructure (`abortCarrierRun`, `RunnerState`).
- Removed the obsolete root-level `models.json`; model registry data remains in `packages/unified-agent/models.json`.
- `oracle.ts`, `athena.ts`, `echelon.ts` carrier definitions (replaced by `nimitz.ts`, `kirov.ts`, `tempest.ts`).

### Notes
- `states.json` entries keyed by retired carrier IDs are dropped at next boot (no migration code added).

## [0.1.2] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- `PI_EXPERIMENTAL` environment flag to opt into experimental extensions during boot.
- GPT-5.5 Codex model entry in `packages/unified-agent/models.json`.
- Provider-specific unified-agent clients for Claude, Codex, and Gemini.
- Codex app-server connection path with dedicated event and lifecycle coverage.
- Unified-agent provider contract E2E coverage.
- `/fleet:update` slash command in the welcome extension that instructs the active PI agent to pull the local `pi-fleet` checkout and apply the `SETUP.md` update steps.
- Prominent full-width update alert banner rendered above the welcome box when the local branch is behind its remote; replaces the duplicate right-column `Update available` block while active, and is fully hidden when up-to-date or no upstream is configured.

### Changed
- Split the monolithic `UnifiedAgentClient` implementation into provider-specific clients.
- Reworked ACP provider execution and stream handling around the new client contracts.
- Updated unified-agent examples, README, and AGENTS guidance for the provider-client architecture.
- Added `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` as a root dependency.

### Fixed
- Echelon repo cloning now uses the OS-native temporary directory.
- Admiral prompts now explicitly require the `pi-tools` MCP availability check.
- Codex commentary events are routed as message chunks.
- Fleet bridge panel widget synchronization now detaches stale panel contexts.
- Welcome extension now renders the current branch name and Fleet version even when the local branch has no upstream configured.

### Removed
- Legacy `ProcessPool` implementation and related benchmark/pool tests.
- Legacy raw ACP session E2E test in favor of provider-level E2E coverage.

### Security
- Welcome extension sanitizes C0 / DEL / C1 control characters from `gitUpdate.branch` and `gitUpdate.version` before rendering to prevent terminal escape injection via crafted branch names or `package.json` version values. The original `GitUpdateStatus` object is not mutated — sanitization is display-only.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- MCP keepalive mechanism (`provider-mcp.ts`): improved MCP server connection stability
- `diagnostics` extension extracted as a standalone module (`extensions/diagnostics/`): dedicated `dummy-arith` diagnostic tool
- Fleet version display in Welcome screen update status line (e.g., `Up to date (main) · v0.1.1`)
- ACP↔MCP bridge redesigned with a robust queue/router model
  - Per-session FIFO tool-call queues and Bearer token isolation for the singleton MCP server
  - Router lifetime preserved across `done="toolUse"` handoffs within the same logical prompt
  - Explicit cleanup logic on `stop`, `error`, or `abort`
  - Single-instance HTTP server with UUID-based opaque paths

### Changed
- Upgraded `pi-sdk` to 0.69 (`package.json`)
- Consolidated sub-package `package-lock.json` files (`core/agentclientprotocol`, `core`, `core/shell`, `fleet`) into the root and removed them
- Updated `SETUP.md` to reflect project setup and structural changes

### Fixed
- Windows: fixed Codex/Claude CLI `spawn` path error (`packages/unified-agent/src/utils/npx.ts`, `BaseConnection.ts`)
- Welcome extension: use `import.meta.url`-based `__dirname` instead of `process.cwd()` for git update check (`extensions/core/welcome/welcome.ts`)
