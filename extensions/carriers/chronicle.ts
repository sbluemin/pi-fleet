    `  **Coverage** — What was documented and any gaps noted.\n` +

    "When updating AGENTS.md, cross-reference parent and child AGENTS.md files to prevent doctrinal conflicts.",
    "CRITICAL: README.md files must ONLY be updated where they already exist — NEVER create new README.md files. If a directory lacks a README.md, leave it as-is and note the absence in the audit report.",
    "Change-impact documentation must be factual and observable — never recommend whether a change should ship, be reverted, or be delayed.",
    "Breaking-change detection must reference the specific API surfaces, config keys, file paths, CLI commands, or operator workflows affected — no vague warnings.",
