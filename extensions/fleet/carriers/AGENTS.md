# carriers

Default carrier definition library — defines individual carriers (genesis, athena, sentinel, vanguard, echelon, chronicle, oracle) that `fleet/index.ts` registers during boot. Chronicle additionally owns change-impact documentation and release communication within the documentation domain.

## Role

This library is responsible solely for **defining carrier instances** for the carrier framework SDK (`shipyard/carrier/`). Each carrier defines its own persona, prompt metadata, and display order (slot).

- `fleet/index.ts` is the only wiring point that registers these carrier modules.
- Without these modules, the `fleet/` extension still functions (framework SDK, Agent Panel, unified pipeline) but has no registered carriers.

## Dependency Rules

### Allowed Imports

| Source | Allowed Target | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| `carriers/*` | `fleet/shipyard/carrier/` | Framework SDK — `registerSingleCarrier`, `CarrierConfig`, types |
| `carriers/*` | `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` | Extension API types |
| `carriers/*` | `@sinclair/typebox` | Schema definitions (if needed) |

### Forbidden Imports

| Source | Forbidden Target | Reason |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| `carriers/*` | `fleet/index.ts` | carriers do not depend on the fleet extension — use only framework SDK |
| `carriers/*` | `fleet/internal/*` | fleet internal implementation is not a concern for carriers |
| `carriers/*` | `fleet/operation-runner.ts` | execution pipeline is accessed indirectly via framework SDK |
| `carriers/*` | `core/*` | direct dependency on other extension layers is forbidden |
| `fleet/shipyard/*`, `fleet/panel/*`, `fleet/render/*`, `fleet/streaming/*` | `carriers/*` | framework internals must remain unaware of carrier persona modules |

### Summary

```
carriers/  →  fleet/shipyard/carrier/ (framework SDK only)
                    ✗ fleet/internal/
                    ✗ core/
```

## Core Rules

- **Each carrier file is independent** — defines its own persona, prompt metadata, and slot. Mutual imports between carriers are forbidden.
- **Prompt text belongs to each carrier file** — intentionally maintain prompts in each carrier file to allow for role divergence. Do not consolidate into `prompts.ts` (this rule is an explicit exception to the `prompts.ts` base rule in `extensions/AGENTS.md`).
- **Slot must be unique across all carriers** — duplicate `CarrierConfig.slot` values will cause ordering conflicts in the Agent Panel.
- **`cliType` is automatically assigned and dynamically changeable** — `registerSingleCarrier` automatically sets `defaultCliType` upon registration, and users can change (override) this at runtime.
- **Only `fleet/index.ts` may import these files for boot-time registration** — keep business logic inside each carrier module.

## Slash Commands

Slash commands registered in this extension use the `fleet:carrier:` domain.
