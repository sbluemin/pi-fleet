# Fleet

> **A Multi-LLM Orchestration Kit**
>
> A custom extension fleet based on [pi-coding-agent](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono).
> The core purpose is to operate 8 carriers — Claude Code, Codex CLI, and Gemini CLI — through a single unified interface.

## Structure

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `docs/pi-development-reference.md` | **Main Developer Guide** — Comprehensive reference for PI SDK, extensions, TUI, themes, and RPC |
| `docs/admiral-workflow-reference.md` | **Operational Doctrine** — High-level architecture, naval hierarchy, and delegation workflows |
| `packages/` | First-party workspace packages: `unified-agent`, `fleet-core`, `fleet-wiki`, `pi-fleet-extension` |
| `packages/fleet-core/` | Pi-agnostic Fleet product core — Fleet domain logic, prompts, runtime contracts, MCP/tool/job internals, **Admiral orchestration runtime**, and public APIs |
| `packages/fleet-core/src/admiral/` | Admiral-owned Fleet orchestration/runtime modules: `_shared/` (detached-fanout), `bridge/`, `carrier/`, `carrier-jobs/`, `squadron/`, `taskforce/`, `store/` (provider-catalog), and `protocols/`. **Standing orders** are integrated under `protocols/standing-orders/`. |
| `packages/fleet-core/src/services/` | Shared pure service modules. Includes `job/`, `log/`, `settings/`, and **tool-registry**. |
| `packages/fleet-core/src/admiralty/` | Grand Fleet domain home inside `fleet-core` (renamed from `gfleet`). Exposed via `@sbluemin/fleet-core/admiralty`. |
| `packages/fleet-core/src/public/` | Public composition surface. Keep `runtime.ts` plus domain service modules only (`fleet-services`, `grand-fleet-services`, `metaphor-services`, `job-services`, `log-services`, `settings-services`). Note that `agent-services`, `tool-registry-services`, and `agent-request` have been removed from the public surface. |
| `packages/pi-fleet-extension/` | Pi capability package — Flat Domain Architecture mirroring fleet-core public services |
| `packages/unified-agent/` | Minimal-dependency SDK for multi-CLI integration (Gemini, Claude, Codex). Now includes `service-status/` for unified health tracking. |
| `packages/pi-fleet-extension/src/` | Root of pi-facing domains |
| `packages/pi-fleet-extension/src/boot.ts` | Entry point — assembles the Fleet runtime by composing domain modules |
| `packages/pi-fleet-extension/src/fleet.ts` | Fleet lifecycle, runtime initialization, and Pi host port implementation |
| `packages/pi-fleet-extension/src/{agent,grand-fleet,fleet-wiki,shell}/` | Domain-internal homes. Each owns its commands, keybinds, tools, and UI. |
| `packages/pi-fleet-extension/src/{fleet,metaphor,job,settings,log,tool-registry}.ts` | Domain entrypoints mapping 1:1 to fleet-core services |
| `packages/pi-fleet-extension/src/{commands,keybinds,tools,tui,provider,session}/` | Removed legacy capability buckets. Do not reintroduce; all features are now organized by domain. |

> Currently, there is no `pi/` directory — symlink setup is not required.
>
> Migration note: the **logical split is already final** (`fleet-core` owns Fleet domain logic including the internalized `admiralty` domain, and `pi-fleet-extension` owns Pi host domains), and `packages/pi-fleet-extension/src/` remains the active physical home for the Flat Domain Architecture.

### Domain Mirror Layout

The `pi-fleet-extension` architecture mirrors the public services of `fleet-core` 1:1. Each core service is mapped to a corresponding domain in the extension.

| fleet-core Public Service | pi-fleet-extension Domain | Description |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| `fleet-services`          | `src/agent/` & `src/fleet.ts` | Agent orchestration, providers, and carrier gateway |
| `grand-fleet-services`    | `src/grand-fleet/`        | Multi-instance Grand Fleet orchestration |
| `metaphor-services`       | `src/metaphor.ts`         | Persona, worldview, and naval metaphors |
| `job-services`            | `src/job.ts`              | Detached carrier job management |
| `settings-services`       | `src/settings.ts`         | Fleet-wide settings and configuration |
| `log-services`            | `src/log.ts`              | Fleet activity logging and categories |
| `@sbluemin/fleet-wiki`    | `src/fleet-wiki/`         | Fleet knowledge base and ingest |
| (Host specific)           | `src/shell/`              | Host shell integration and terminal features |


## Fleet Architecture (Metaphor)

This project is an **Agent Harness** that centrally commands and orchestrates powerful CLI tools (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, etc.), each of which possesses its own internal sub-agent system.

Beyond simple parallel API calls, the system adopts a **naval fleet metaphor** to clearly separate roles and responsibilities across the architecture.

### Core Entities

| Layer | Entity | Metaphor | Definition |
|-------|--------|----------|------------|
| 1 | **Admiral of the Navy** (ATN) | 대원수 (User) | **The user** who wields the tool. Sets ultimate strategy and final objectives for the fleet. |
| 2 | **Fleet Admiral** | 사령관 (Grand Fleet) | The **Admiralty LLM persona** (internalized domain in `fleet-core`). Responsible for multi-fleet orchestration. *Does not exist in single-fleet mode; the user communicates directly with the Admiral.* |
| 3 | **Admiral** | 제독 (Host PI) | A single **workspace PI instance**. Plans operations and dispatches Carriers within its operational zone. |
| 4 | **Captain** | 함장 (Carrier Persona) | The **persona of a Carrier agent**. While a Carrier is the system entity, the Captain is its personified commander. |

> **Note on Persona & Tone**: The naming conventions, personified personas, and linguistic tone for all tiers are centrally managed by `packages/fleet-core/src/metaphor/`. The former `packages/pi-fleet-extension/src/metaphor/` legacy directory has been removed and must not be recreated as a Pi-side domain home.

#### Carrier vs Captain Separation
- **Carrier**: The **system entity** (ID: `genesis`, `sentinel`, etc.). Represents the execution instance, process, and configuration.
- **Captain**: The **commander persona** of that Carrier. Represents the "voice" and "character" (e.g., Chief Engineer, Scout Specialist) that communicates with the Admiral.

## Architecture — Agent Workflow

PI is the **host agent** (orchestrator). Registered Carriers are **sub-agents** that execute independently via ACP protocol.

### Speakers

| Speaker | Role |
|---------|------|
| **PI** (host) | Orchestrator — routes requests, invokes tools, synthesizes cross-reports |
| **Nimitz** (sub) | CVN-09 Strategic Command & Judgment — read-only (Claude Code CLI via ACP) |
| **Kirov** (sub) | CVN-02 Operational Planning Bridge (Claude Code CLI via ACP) |
| **Genesis** (sub) | CVN-01 Chief Engineer — single-shot implementation under Admiral direction (Codex CLI via ACP) |
| **Ohio** (sub) | CVN-10 Multi-Wave Strike Execution — receives `plan_file` from Kirov; sole plan-driven executor (Codex CLI via ACP) |
| **Sentinel** (sub) | CVN-04 The Inquisitor / QA & Security Lead (Codex CLI via ACP) |
| **Vanguard** (sub) | CVN-06 Scout Specialist (Codex CLI via ACP) |
| **Tempest** (sub) | CVN-07 Forward External Intelligence Strike (Gemini CLI via ACP) |
| **Chronicle** (sub) | CVN-08 Chief Knowledge Officer — documentation, change-impact summaries, and release communication (Gemini CLI via ACP) |

### Execution Modes

| Mode | Trigger | Flow |
|------|---------|------|
| **Fleet Action** | Alt+1 (Active Protocol) | PI handles directly (no sub-agents) — Standard workflow |
| **Tool delegation** | PI's own judgment | PI → tool_call(any carrier) → sub-agent result → PI synthesizes |
| **Bridge (single)** | Alt+T | User → single sub-agent shell (PI acts as router only, no synthesis) |

## Operational Protocols & Standing Orders

The Admiral extension implements a modular prompt policy system that governs how the host agent (PI) operates. This system is composed of **Standing Orders** and **Protocols**.

### Core Concepts

| Concept | Definition | Scope |
|---------|------------|-------|
| **Standing Orders** | Cross-cutting mechanisms always injected into the system prompt. | Global — applies to all sessions and protocols. |
| **Protocols** | Mutually exclusive workflows that define the current operational mode. | Session-specific — exactly one protocol is always active. |

### Standing Orders

- **Delegation Policy**: Defines how and when PI should delegate tasks to carriers.
- **Deep Dive**: Strategy for recursive investigation and root-cause analysis.
- **Always Active**: These are injected into every agent start sequence regardless of the selected protocol.

### Protocols

- **Fleet Action Protocol (Alt+1)**: The default, high-performance workflow for standard operations.
- **Modular Expansion**: Additional protocols (e.g., specific research or refactoring modes) can be assigned to `Alt+2` through `Alt+9`.
- **Switching**: Protocols are switched via dedicated hotkeys. Only one protocol can be active at a time; deactivation is not possible (switching only).

### Prompt Structure

에이전트에게 전달되는 최종 시스템 프롬프트는 다음과 같은 계층 구조로 합성됩니다:

```text
System Prompt
  + [Boot] Initial Slate (PI_FLEET_DEV=1 시 RISEN 개발 컨텍스트, 그 외 빈 문자열)
  + [Toggle] Worldview (via metaphor:worldview)
  + [Always] Standing Orders (Delegation Policy + Deep Dive + ...)
  + [Always] Active Protocol (Fleet Action Protocol, etc.)
  + [Always] request_directive guide
```

### UI & UX Integration

- **Editor Border Color**: The editor's border color changes based on the active protocol (communicated via `globalThis.__pi_hud_editor_border_color__`).
- **aboveEditor Widget**: Displays the active protocol label (e.g., `⚓ Fleet Action Protocol`) above the input field.
- **Settings Popup (Alt+/)**: The "Admiral" section allows manual selection of the `activeProtocol` and toggling of the `worldview`.

### Key Bindings

| Key | Protocol / Action |
|-----|-------------------|
| **Alt+1** | Switch to Fleet Action Protocol |
| **Alt+2~9** | Switch to dynamically assigned protocols |
| **Alt+/** | Open Settings (to configure Admiral parameters) |

## Fleet Architecture (Metaphor)


- **Sub-agents are fully independent** — PI provides only background, objectives, and constraints. Never prescribe implementation details.
- **Sub-agents are unaware of each other** — Cross-analysis is performed solely by PI after all responses are collected.
- **Communication layer**: pi consumers call `executeWithPool()` / `executeOneShot()` from `@sbluemin/fleet-core/admiral/agent-runtime` directly → ACP stdio (all CLIs use the same protocol).

## PI TUI Layout & Terminology

PI renders a vertical stack of **zones**. Extensions customize these zones via official TUI APIs.

```
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│  Header                          │  built-in
├──────────────────────────────────┤
│  Messages                        │  built-in · registerMessageRenderer()
├──────────────────────────────────┤
│  Widget:above                    │  setWidget()

└──────────────────────────────────┘
  Overlay                            ctx.ui.custom() — floating
```

### Canonical Terms

| Term | Zone | Owner | Notes |
|------|------|-------|-------|
| **Header** | Header | pi | Startup info, badges |
| **Messages** | Messages | pi | Conversation, tool calls/results, custom messages |
| **Editor** | Editor | `core/hud` | User input (HUD replaces default) |
| **Footer** | Footer | `core/hud` | Bottom tokens — dir, session, cost, model (HUD replaces default) |
| **Status Bar** | Widget:above | `core/hud` | Segment-based status line above Editor |
| **Agent Panel** | Custom UI | `fleet` | Carrier streaming UI — exclusive / multi-column / compact view |
| **Streaming Widget** | Widget | `fleet` | 1-line compact indicator when Agent Panel is collapsed |
| **Overlay** | Overlay | various | Floating panel — keybind (Alt+.), settings (Alt+/), welcome |

### Rules

- Use the **canonical terms** above in all code comments, docs, and AGENTS.md files.
- When an extension contributes UI, note which **zone** and **API** it targets.

## Domain Boundary Rules

> Refer to `package AGENTS.md files` for the full cross-layer dependency rules, layer hierarchy, and verification table.

## Slash Command Naming

All slash commands registered by extensions must follow this naming convention.

### Format

```
fleet:<domain>:<feature>
```

- **All lowercase** — No uppercase letters, no underscores.
- **`:` as separator** — Use `:` between segments. Do not use `-`, `_`, or `/`.
- **Exactly 3 segments** — `fleet` prefix + domain + feature. Do not nest further.

### Domain Assignment

Each feature area maps to exactly one command domain. Use the domain below regardless of historical directory names or removed legacy homes.

| Feature Area | Domain | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| `fleet` agent orchestration surfaces | `agent` | Sub-agent orchestration features |
| `fleet-wiki` surfaces | `wiki` | Fleet Wiki store, patch queue, ingest |
| Admiral protocol and doctrine surfaces | `admiral` | Host-agent prompt policy, protocols, and operational doctrine |
| Detached carrier job surfaces | `jobs` | Detached carrier job rendering and verbose toggle |
| Metaphor/persona/worldview surfaces | `metaphor` | Naval Fleet persona prompts, worldview management, and shared metaphor controls |
| Carrier registration surfaces | `carrier` | Individual carrier registration and configuration |
| HUD display surfaces | `hud` | HUD / editor display features |
| Operation naming surfaces | `metaphor:operation` | Session operation naming settings |
| Directive refinement surfaces | `metaphor:directive` | Directive refinement (3-section) settings |
When adding a **new extension**, assign a domain that reflects the **feature category**, not the directory prefix (`core-`, etc.).

### Feature Naming

- Use a **verb or noun** that describes the action or target — e.g., `status`, `editor`, `models`, `settings`, `worldview`.
- Prefer short, unambiguous words. Avoid abbreviations (`settings` not `cfg`, `status` not `stat`).
- `settings` — reserved for commands that open a configuration UI for that domain.
- `run` — reserved for manual re-trigger of an automated behavior (e.g., re-summarize on demand).

### Conflict Prevention

- The `fleet:` prefix is **reserved for this project**. Never register commands without it.
- Domain names are shared across extensions — coordinate to avoid feature name collisions within a domain.

### When to Apply

- Apply this naming from the **first `registerCommand` call** in a new extension — do not rename later.
- Commands without the `fleet:` prefix must be renamed before they are merged into active extensions.

## TypeScript File Structure

All `.ts` source files must follow this top-to-bottom declaration order:

```
imports → types/interfaces → constants → functions
```

- **Imports** — external packages first, then internal modules.
- **Types / Interfaces** — `interface` and `type` declarations only; no logic.
- **Constants** — `const` declarations. Module-private constants are `const` (unexported); public ones are `export const`.
- **Functions** — exported functions first, then internal helpers at the bottom.

Do **not** interleave constants and functions, or declare types mid-file.

## Git Guidelines

- **Commit Message Format:** Strictly adhere to the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.
  - Allowed types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`.
- **Language:** All commit messages **MUST be written in English**.

## Changelog Guidelines

- **Language:** `CHANGELOG.md` **MUST be written entirely in English** — entries, descriptions, and all prose.
- **Format:** Follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) conventions (`Added`, `Changed`, `Fixed`, `Removed`, `Breaking Changes` subsections).
- **Versioning:** Each release maps to a git tag (e.g., `## [0.1.1] - YYYY-MM-DD`). The `[Unreleased]` section stays empty until the next release is cut.
